Assignment 3: Machine Learning Model for Student Routine

Problem Statement:
Create a machine learning model to predict a student's next-day routine based on various factors like their current routine, academic schedule, and lifestyle habits.

Data Acquisition:
Conduct a survey of 100 students to gather data on their daily routines, including:
Academic schedule (class timings, self-study hours)
Extracurricular activities
Lifestyle habits (sleep, exercise, hobbies)
Academic goals and priorities

Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or deletion).
Remove inconsistencies and errors in the data.

Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features from the raw data, such as:
Time spent on different activities
Weekday/Weekend indicator
Academic term (semester, vacation)

Data Transformation:
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

Model Building:
Choose a Suitable Algorithm:
Consider algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.

Train the Model:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.

Evaluate the Model:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Model Deployment:
Create a User Interface:
Design a user-friendly interface (e.g., web app, mobile app) to collect user input.

Integrate the Model:
Deploy the trained model to the backend of the application.

Provide Predictions:
When a user provides their current routine and other relevant information, the model predicts their next-day routine.
